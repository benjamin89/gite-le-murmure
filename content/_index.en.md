Le Murmure is a holiday home in Chez Porte, a lieu-dit of 7 houses, 4 km from Pionsat. The house is located right next to the authentic source. “Le Murmure” is the French word for 'murmuring, whispering' and refers to the flowing water of the source.
The house is a renovated former stable, where an attempt has been made to preserve the rural French atmosphere as much as possible.
The living room-dining kitchen is spacious and atmospheric, equipped with a new pellet stove and a cozy sitting area with Dutch satellite TV and WiFi. The sofa can also serve as a double bed. There is also a well-stocked library and all kinds of board games.
The dining kitchen has a refrigerator with freezer compartment, combination microwave, four-burner gas hob, the latest Senseo machine (pads/ground coffee) and toaster. There is a well-stocked crockery cupboard and sufficient storage space for your own belongings.
The bathroom has a spacious shower, sink, toilet and sufficient storage space.
On the first floor there are two large, communicating bedrooms. The first bedroom has a double bed (160 x 200) with a view of the original beams. In the second bedroom there are two single beds, separated by a storage unit filled with all kinds of games. There is also a table football game here that can also be converted into 20 other games and there is a sofa to "chill".

The garden area offers a lot of privacy and consists partly of gravel, grass and shaded terrace. From the garden you have a beautiful view over the hills of the Auvergne. Garden furniture is sufficiently available.

You have your own parking space.

The detached holiday home is next to the house of the owners, where you can always go with questions. Possibly while enjoying a drink!
